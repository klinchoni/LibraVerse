# 👑Roles👑
## 👨🏻‍💻User👨🏻‍💻
Users possess the capability to browse through an extensive catalog of books, view detailed information about various bookstores along with their available inventory, read engaging articles, and discover upcoming events. Additionally, users can contribute to the community by adding comments to books, articles, or events. They are also empowered to compose comprehensive reviews and provide ratings for books, articles, and events. Moreover, users have the autonomy to delete or edit their comments and reviews. They can curate their personal reading journey by adding books to their "My Books" section, categorizing them as "Want To Read," "Currently Reading," or "Read."

## ✍🏼Publisher✍🏼
Publishers enjoy the same privileges as users, with the added authority to manage content more comprehensively. They can add new books, bookstores, articles, and events, as well as edit or delete existing entries. This expanded set of permissions allows publishers to maintain and enrich the content available to all users.

## 💸ADMIN💸
Admins hold the same permissions as publishers but with additional administrative capabilities within the "Actions" section. This unique section grants admins the ability to elevate users to the role of publisher or admin and to revoke such statuses when necessary. This ensures a robust and dynamic management structure, enabling the seamless promotion and demotion of users within the platform.
